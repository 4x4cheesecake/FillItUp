Assembly Fuel Utility is a very simple mod for Kerbal Space Program which allows you to easily adjust the fuel levels in all your fuel tanks in the SPH and VAB.

I created this mainly for my own use when building balanced space planes, but thought I would share it in case anyone else finds it useful.

A perhaps interesting point for the technically inclined is the use of javascript (enabled by Jint) for the the UI rendering code (see afu_scripts.js) which makes it much easier to design, as code can be modified on the fly.
