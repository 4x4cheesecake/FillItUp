Assembly Fuel Utility is a very simple mod for Kerbal Space Program which allows you to easily adjust the fuel levels in all your fuel tanks in the SPH and VAB.

I created this mainly for my own use when building balanced space planes, but thought I would share it in case anyone else finds it useful and/or informative.

When learning how to mod KSP, I found it difficult to find any simple examples of a 'partless' mod, and so perhaps someone will also find this useful in that regard.

A perhaps interesting point for the technically inclined is the use of javascript (enabled by Jint) for the the UI rendering code (see afu_scripts.js) which I find makes UI design much easier, as code can be modified and the changes viewed on the fly.
